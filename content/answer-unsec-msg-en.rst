I thank you for your message and I'll be pleased to answer to
you. However, I'll answer only through a **secured communication
channel** because I'm concerned about the security and privacy of my
network and of our communications. Consequently, I invite you to send
me your messages through any of the following secured channels:

* By E-mail (at jbc *at* gmx.se, for instance, or `to any of my
  certified E-mail addresses
  <https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xA3EF734C0A6C388C>`_),
  **encrypting your messages** with `GPG
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard>`_;

* Through any of the following instant messaging services,
  **encrypting our messages** with `OTR
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging>`_:

  * `Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/>`_ (speredenn *at* facebook.com);
  * `Twitter <https://www.twitter.com/>`_ (speredenn *at* twitter.com) ;
  * `GTalk <https://mail.google.com/>`_ (sprdnn *at* gmail.com) ;
  * `Jabber <http://www.jabber.org/>`_ (jbc *at* jabber.dk) ;
  * `IRC <https://www.freenode.net/>`_ (speredenn *at* freenode.net)
  * `ICQ <https://www.icq.com/>`_ (482685177)
  * `Yahoo! <https://www.yahoo.com/>`_ (jbc *at* gmx.se)

* Through `Telegram <https://telegram.org/>`_ or `TextSecure
  <https://whispersystems.org/>`_, which are pieces of Android
  software **using cryptography and encryption accessible to
  everybody**;

* By phoning me with a `SIP account <https://ostel.co/>`_ (speredenn
  at ostel.co) **encrypting our call** with `ZRTP
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP>`_ and `SRTP
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRTP>`_, or with `RedPhone
  <https://whispersystems.org/>`_;

* By postal mail, **encrypting your letter, or the microSD card** that
  you will have taped against a lovely postcard, before inserting it
  in the envelope;

If the above technologies are perfectly unknown to you, I invite you
to `teach yourself what it is all about
<http://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters>`_
urgently, **as you threaten your family and friends network** when you
use unsecured communication channels. Of course, I would be pleased to
introduce the good practices to you myself, if you wish for it.

I hope to get news from you through one of those secured communication
channels anytime soon!

Best!

:P.S.: **Check with me my keys or certificates fingerprints** ! I will
       also be happy to give you my mobile phone number or my mail
       address through one of the above secured channels, or
       personally via a meeting IRL, if you do not have them already.

:P.P.S.: Do you use `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ and the
         `https
         <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperText_Transfer_Protocol_Secure>`_
         protocol when you browse the web? The `EFF
         <https://www.eff.org/about>`_ `explains
         <https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https>`_ clearly why you
         might be interested to use this tool and protocol.
